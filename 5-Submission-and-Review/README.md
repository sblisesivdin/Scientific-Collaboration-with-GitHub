# Submission and Review

Submission and Review of the prepared manuscript is the very important part of the process. To select a proper joural is one of the important things. For a multi-author study which is totally done remotely, one can ask the opinion of a senior researcher, otherwise a democtratic voting process will be the logical choice.

# Journal voting

For the voting, the most important thing will be to hide the votes of people from others. For this **corresponding author will take the responsibility of collecting votes and then announce**

Therefore, when the manuscript is finished, the following scheme can be suggested to follow:

1. Corresponding author will announce a call for suggesting journal names. There must be a deadline for this process (1 week is more than enough).
2. For example, total of 7 journals are suggested by authors. All suggested journal names will be announced to authors by corresponding author like:

| No: | Journal Name | Author 1 | Author 2 | Author 3 |
| --- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1   | Journal 1    |          |          |          |
| 2   | Journal 2    |          |          |          |
| 3   | Journal 3    |          |          |          |
| 4   | Journal 4    |          |          |          |
| 5   | Journal 5    |          |          |          |
| 6   | Journal 6    |          |          |          |
| 7   | Journal 7    |          |          |          |

and **weighted** votes will be requested. For 7 journals, authors will give each journal a vote from 1 to 7 (each will be used once). At the end, corresponding author will use his/her vote.

3. After getting votes, corresponding author will announce the total votes:

| No: | Journal Name | Author 1 | Author 2 | Author 3 | TOTAL |
| --- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1   | Journal 1    |     7    |    6     |    7     |  20   |
| 2   | Journal 2    |     4    |    4     |    6     |  14   |
| 3   | Journal 3    |     3    |    2     |    4     |   9   |
| 4   | Journal 4    |     6    |    5     |    2     |  13   |
| 5   | Journal 5    |     1    |    1     |    3     |   5   |
| 6   | Journal 6    |     2    |    3     |    1     |   6   |
| 7   | Journal 7    |     5    |    7     |    5     |  17   |

Therefore, corresponding author will submit the manuscript firstly to Journal 1. If it will be rejected from Journal 1, then it will be submitted to Journal 7. Then (hopefully not) Journal2, 4, 3, 6 and lastly 5.
