# Manuscript Preparation

## Writing Manuscript

We will take the IMRAD format for the SCoG process. Because, IMRAD is the most common physical structure for science papers.

Therefore, we are accepting that we have some sections in our study:
* Introduction : This part has three "unnamed" subsections.
  * Opening : Introduces the problem, and the tools or methods
  * Background : What authors did and why it is important,
  * Challenge : Specific hypotheses/questions/goals of the proposed study.
* Materials / Methods : What and how did you do the study.
  * Figures: There may be a single figure (no limit but, mostly like this) explaning the method or the structure of materials used,
  * Tables: Like figures, it may have a single table to explain the method or the structure of materials used.
* Results and Discussion : Your findings.
  * Figures: As they said, one figure is explaining a 100 words. You need to report your findings here with the help of figures...
  * Tables: ...and tables.
