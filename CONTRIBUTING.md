# How to contribute*

**SCoG need volunteer developers. We welcome all contributions and discussions. Let's discuss how we can do science on GitHub! Please use Issues to discuss and send pull request to help development!**

Contributing to SCoG is easy. It all starts with a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/). Firstly, you need to fork the repository, work on it and raise a pull request to introduce your changes to us.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to SCoG](https://github.com/sblisesivdin/Scientific-Collaboration-with-Github/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).  Please follow the rules (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A note describing what changed and its impact."

## Rules

We need guidelines to communicate better and better readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source project. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

Thanks in advance for your contribution.
