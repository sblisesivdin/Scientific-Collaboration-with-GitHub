# Analyzes
This folder will include further analyzes like mobility analyzes, Fourier transforms of experimental data, etc... in experimental studies or band-calculations, phonon calculations kind of things. Therefore the directory must include many Excel/Libreoffice Calc sheets, Origin/SigmaPlot/MagicPlot/Veusz/SciDavis type of figures and fittings.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Because there will be many contributers in the study, the software must be standardized. It is not ethical and legal to use Excel/Origin/Sigmaplot with unsuitable licensing. It is very important that the contributers must push them strong to use standardized tools and software. You may use cloud based collaboration tools like Google Docs, Nextcloud, or you can use files.

## Tools and Software
(You can change these lines for your needs)
* For spreadsheet needs Linux/Mac/Windows users "must" use Libreoffice Calc. Files must be saved in XLSX format.
* For drawing and simple analyses Linux/Mac/Windows users "must" use Veusz. Files must be saved in VSZ format.

OR

* For spreadsheet needs please refer our Google Docs Folder (You can add a link here), add Sheet document in the folder.
